# Automatic Condition Detection of Vehicle Tires with a Deep Learning Approach Supported by a Smart Mobile Application
This project aims to overcome the limitations of traditional tire condition detection methods. These methods often rely on manual or visual assessment, which can be uncertain and prone to high error rates. Users may not always have access to expert opinions, leading to delayed decisions regarding tire changes, which compromises traffic and safety. Through this project, we aim to provide users with a faster and more reliable tire evaluation experience by automatically detecting tire conditions using deep learning methods. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance the safety of vehicles actively engaged in traffic.
